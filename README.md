# MAM Liteâ€Š-â€Šan alternative messaging protocol forÂ IOTA

MAM Lite (MAML) is a  lightweight, flexible and easy to use protocol which ensures privacy and integrity for data communication at another level. More information about MAML can be found here: https://medium.com/@samuel.rufinatscha/mam-lite-an-alternative-messaging-protocol-for-iota-562fdd318e1d

Features
- Authentication
- Forward Secrecy
- Spam protection
- Stream access from every address
- Channel splitting
- Multipart messages (Public & Private)
- Different encryption modes (OTP and public key encryption for fine grained access)

I have designed the library to be as easy to use as possible.
Every author of a message does need a RSA key pair. This can be created easily by the provided crypto classes:

```js
KeyPair keys = RSA.generateKeyPair();
PublicKey publicKey = keys.getPublic();
PrivateKey privateKey = keys.getPrivate();
```

A channel can be created as follows:

```js
MAMLite m = new MAMLite(address, password);
```
Publishing of a message:

```js    
Message m = new Message("My public data", "My private data", publicKey);
m.write(m, privateKey);
```

Reading of a message:

```js
Message m = m.read();
```

Loading another stream using the same MAML object:

```js
m.load(address, password);
```

To split a channel, you simply need to change the password. The rest is done automatically:

```js
m.split(newPassword);
```
